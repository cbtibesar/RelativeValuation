# RelativeValuation
The easiest way to get started is to set up a python environment using anaconda, and install the dependencies with that.
After activating your conda environment, run: 
`conda install django`, 
`pip install djangorestframework`, and 
`pip install yfinance`

This will add all the dependencies you need, so long as you are using an anaconda environment.

Once the code is cloned, navigate to relative_valuation and run `python manage.py runserver`, while still utilizing your environment,
which will run the server on your local machine at localhost:8000.
